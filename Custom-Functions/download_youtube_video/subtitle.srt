1
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,640
Me? Hi.

2
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm trying to relax.

3
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,920
Would you mind? Oh, sorry. Mr.

4
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,680
Hey, kid,

5
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,720
just come over here and sit down, would you?

6
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,710
What's your name? Mr. My name is Adam.

7
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,062
You look like my grandpa, except he's not as old.

8
00:00:58,196 --> 00:01:01,646
That's very rude. I'm Adam. Who are

9
00:01:01,668 --> 00:01:02,240
you?

10
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,970
Joseph. Where's your mother?

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,922
She's with her boyfriend. Supposed to wait over

12
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:12,580
here.

13
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm eight and three quarters. Mr. How old are you?

14
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,270
Mr. You're boring.

15
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,140
Listen, kid, I'd like some peace and quiet, please.

16
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,986
You're grumpy. Mr. Is that why that woman left you on the

17
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,370
bench? Was she your girlfriend?

18
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,630
No, she wasn't.

19
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,366
Listen, I have a girlfriend. Mr. And I'm

20
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:50,750
only in the second grade. Where's your girlfriend?

21
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,602
My wife Elizabeth is

22
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:58,260
gone.

23
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,700
Well, where has she gone to?

24
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,830
She's gone. Gone dead.

25
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,670
Oh, that's sad.

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,720
Well, my girlfriend Katie, she's still really young.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,050
Was she a good girlfriend?

28
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,020
Katie's the best I've had,

29
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,740
yes. Elizabeth was one of a kind.

30
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,950
Why? Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

31
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,966
Yesterday I brought Katie a flower and she

32
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,710
gave me a kiss on the cheek.

33
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,498
Have you ever brought a girl a flower? Kid, you've got a

34
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:52,322
lot to learn about relationships. Have you ever looked

35
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:56,054
into someone's eyes and had a whole conversation in an

36
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:56,790
instant,

37
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,786
laughed with someone, kept laughing until you even forgot

38
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:03,990
why you were laughing?

39
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,318
Have you ever cried? I cried last night when I said goodbye

40
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:10,330
to Katie,

41
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,370
but that was because I had scraped my knee badly.

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,200
Mr. Yes.

43
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,360
Are you going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?

44
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,080
No. I'm happy just by myself.

45
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,510
I think you're grumpy.

46
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,820
I have lots of girlfriends. Mr. Over six.

47
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,120
Lizie was my one and only.

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,230
You talk about your girlfriend a lot. My wife.

49
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,040
I love getting girlfriends. Mr. You should try it.

50
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,770
There's not enough time left for me for those kind of shenanigans.

51
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,710
Plus, I thought I was a boring,

52
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,490
grumpy old guy. Nah,

53
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,090
you're nice. Well, once you stop breeding.

54
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,200
See that pretty girl over there?

55
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,350
I'm about to get a new girlfriend in 10 seconds.

56
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,400
There's always time.

57
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,150
Got to go. Mr. Bye bye.

58
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,160
Nice day, isn't it? Yeah,

59
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,550
it's beautiful. Really? Enjoy the park.

1
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,766
Me? Hi. I'm trying to

2
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:31,158
relax. Would you mind?

3
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,920
Oh, sorry. Mr.

4
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,680
Hey, kid,

5
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,720
just come over here and sit down, would you?

6
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,710
What's your name? Mr. My name is Adam.

00:00:58,196 --> 00:01:01,242
That's very rude. I'm Adam.

9
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:02,240
Who are you?

10
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,970
Joseph. Where's your mother?

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,922
She's with her boyfriend. Supposed to wait over

12
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:15,446

gone.

23
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,140
Well, where has she gone to? She's gone.

24
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,830
Gone dead.

25
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,670
Oh, that's sad.

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,720
