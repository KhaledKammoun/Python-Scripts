# Code Execution Example

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to create, write, read, and execute code from a file.

## Code Explanation

The `execute_code.py` script performs the following steps:

1. It writes a Python code snippet to a file named `new_file.py`.
2. It reads the contents of `new_file.py`.
3. It executes the code using the `exec()` function.

The code snippet in `new_file.py` generates numbers from 0 to 9 and prints whether each number is odd or even.

## Usage

1. Run the `execute_code.py` script to execute the code in `new_file.py`:
